abstract = {Current theory of face-based trait impressions focuses on their foundation in facial morphology, from which emerges a correlation structure of face impressions due to shared feature dependence, “face trait space.” Here, we proposed that perceivers’ lay conceptual beliefs about how personality traits correlate structure their face impressions. We demonstrate that “conceptual trait space” explains a substantial portion of variance in face trait space. Further, we find that perceivers who believe any set of personality traits (e.g., trustworthiness, intelligence) is more correlated in others use more similar facial features when making impressions of those traits. These findings suggest lay conceptual beliefs about personality play a crucial role in face-based trait impressions and may underlie both their similarities and differences across perceivers. Humans seamlessly infer the expanse of personality traits from others’ facial appearance. These facial impressions are highly intercorrelated within a structure known as “face trait space.” Research has extensively documented the facial features that underlie face impressions, thus outlining a bottom-up fixed architecture of face impressions, which cannot account for important ways impressions vary across perceivers. Classic theory in impression formation emphasized that perceivers use their lay conceptual beliefs about how personality traits correlate to form initial trait impressions, for instance, where trustworthiness of a target may inform impressions of their intelligence to the extent one believes the two traits are related. This considered, we explore the possibility that this lay “conceptual trait space”—how perceivers believe personality traits correlate in others—plays a role in face impressions, tethering face impressions to one another, thus shaping face trait space. In study 1, we found that conceptual and face trait space explain considerable variance in each other. In study 2, we found that participants with stronger conceptual associations between two traits judged those traits more similarly in faces. Importantly, using a face image classification task, we found in study 3 that participants with stronger conceptual associations between two traits used more similar facial features to make those two face trait impressions. Together, these findings suggest lay beliefs of how personality traits correlate may underlie trait impressions, and thus face trait space. This implies face impressions are not only derived bottom up from facial features, but also shaped by our conceptual beliefs.}
